This project is a simple web page that allows you to keep track of any and all job applications that you have submitted.

## Conception
Since I have been applying for jobs, one of the hardest aspects for me is keeping track of who or what I have applied to.  I have tried several different options and ideas such as:
* Specific email folder
* spreadsheet
* list in a document
* good old pen and paper

But, I did not find anything that I really liked.  They all had their own drawbacks.  So, per my usual mentality if I cant find a solution that I like I will make one instead.

## Requirments
* at a glance allow me to see what applications that I have outstanding
* show only the basic information, and then expand into more information about the job
* easily add a new job application
* easily update current applications with status changes and/or notes

### How it works

Application tracker allows you to keep track of your job searches.  At the top of the screen is a button, that will let you update your job search.
